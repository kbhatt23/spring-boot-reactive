Tomcat takes servlet container in spring boot as embeded tomcat server , 
In Spring boot tomcat is embeded, so the max thread can be manipulated in application.properties
	-> server.tomcat.max-threads -> this give thread pool max size -> these threads as part of servlet container(tomcat role) individually serve the request from client
									-> this model is termed as thread per rquest model
	-> This do not mean we give huge size of max thread pool size and win
	-> as each thread have memory in RAM and it can make the performace bad as well if set to large value

so to handle huge request we can use horizontal scaling of apps using kubernetes or contianer orchestration but is costly

so reactive programming try to get away from thread per request model

here we try to create more threads from the main thread and do tasks asynchronously -> hence utilization of resource is increased without increase in cost 	
	-> similiar to asynchronous programming -> non blocking like futures

flow of tech stack in java that try to solve above issue

a. callables : runs in seperate thread , it do not returns anything and also hard to maintain
b. future: runs in seperate thread it returns value , however multiple asynch task can not be done
c. copletalblefuture -> easy to mainitain , same as future but cna handle multiple tasks asynchronously ,functional style and hecne easy to maintain

but c is still tough and can be made better using spring reactive -> easy to use
in completable future there is no back pressure support of data
in reactrive programming there is back pressure support -> eg in reactive data comes like stream/even so each event will have only one item
	this allows the service that calls db to process one by one and help in back pressure support

also there is not good enough error handling support in completable future


This means reactive programming have all feature of completable future + back pressure supports-> allowing consumer to tackle huge data tasks
In JPa complatableFuture<List<ITem>> will be non lbocking but will eventually return all list items at once	
					-> this will make tough for service class to handle and hence no back support
in reactive programming -> it return stream/even one by one

=======Reactive programming also solve issue with DB, 
a. if DB is sending huge data then with traditional API it will crash and there is no communication to tell DB to slow down so that api can handle it
This can be solved using reactive programming -> back pressure compatibility

Issues with old traditional API
a. Can not handle huge concurrent requests.
b. latency is slow
c. Can not handle DB back pressure

best API design approach
a. Async and non blocking features
b. move away from therad per rquest
c. back pressure support in db
d. use fewer threads and utilize them using reactive programming to fullest - > as each thread takes lot of memory

General example in real life scenario:
a. imperative programming -> call > communcation happens only at that time
b. reactive programming -> messaging -> can happen async

Reactive programming is simpilkiar to reactive APIS but are more generic
Data flows and back support is for streams/events in reactive programming howver in reactive API it have back pressure support on db as well

Reactive Stream concepts(part of java 8)==========================

interfaces
a. publisher : this represents data source, it has data stream . 
b. subscriber : this repreent businsess app that wants to access data from publkisher
c. subscription : this is piplein between the above 2
methods:
publisher -> subscribe(Subscriber s)
Subscriber -> onNext(T t) -> gets called n number of times T represent single entry put of n data requested
	 -> onComplete() : gets called at the end success
	 -> onError() - >gets called if any error occurred in subsciber
Subscription -> cancel -> after calling this no event gets triggered from publisher like on next or oncomplete, on error etc
	     -> request(long n) -> start eh cahin, publisher callls subscriber n number of time with individual entries

whole flow
Susbcriber calls subscibe function and pass subscriber object -> publisher sends Subscription object to Subscriber
		-> Subscriber calls cancel or request function of Subscription -> then Publisher calls on next events n number of times
		-> then publisher calls on complete funciton or onerror function o Subscriber

The above specification is generic and is used by a lot of libraries
Means all of them have implementation of above 4 interfaces(Subscriber, Publisher, Subscription , Processor)
libraries eg: 
RX java
project reactor(spring boot default and recommened)
JDK 9 : Flow classes


Testing using assert can be done usingStepverifier in webflux
The exact sequence of events can be verified creating Stepverifier instance

We can combine fluxes in 3 ways:
a. merge : it do in paralle but sequence is not amintained
b. concat : same as merge(runs inb parallel) and sequence is mainied -> slower than merge
c. zip: it is special case when n'th char of each flux is combonecd together
eg -> a,b,c : fluxa
	  d,r,f : fluxb
	  when merged reuslt to ad,br,cf : coding is similar to reduce in streams
